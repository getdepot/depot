# Privacy Policy

Depot's privacy policy is simple: 

- I don't collect any data from you using the app. 
- The app itself has absolutely no analytics code, no behavior tracking, and no A/B testing. 
- If you have enabled App Analytics in macOS, Apple may supply anonymous crash reports to help me identify issues in the app.
